					You can't buy happiness, it comes to you. No one can offer
					unconditional love and companionship a pet can. When you adopt a dog
					or cat, you are not only getting a wonderful life companion, but you
					are also saving a life and giving an animal a loving home it deserves.
				</p>
				<p>
					The war unleashed against Ukraine brought pain and suffering not only
					to millions of people, but also to many animals. Some of them were
					abandoned or lost, others have tragically lost their owners... Now
					they are looking for pet parents, as well as other homeless animals
					who have never had them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even if you are not ready to adopt a pet yet, your donation or any
					other kind of support can save little creatures.
